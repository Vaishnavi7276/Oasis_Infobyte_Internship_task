                <h2>Who was Savitribai Phule?</h2>
                <p>
                  Savitribai Phule (1831–1897) was a revolutionary social reformer, educationist, and poet who played a crucial role in women's education in India. She, along with her husband Jyotirao Phule, fought against social injustices, particularly in the field of caste and gender discrimination.

                <p>
                  In an era when educating women was taboo, she courageously established the first girls' school in India in 1848. Despite facing severe opposition, she continued to empower women and oppressed communities through education.

                  Apart from being a teacher and activist, she was a poet whose works inspired people to rise against discrimination and strive for equality.
